###Plugins
* [http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/)
  * I used this plugin for the background image for the site
  
* [http://marktyrrell.com/labs/blueberry/](http://marktyrrell.com/labs/blueberry/t)
  * I used this plugin for the image slider on the main page

###Written Code
* The custom written JavaScript is an onclick alert. When a user clicks on the logo image on either page, an alert pops up with a message. The code retrieves the logo's id and proceeds with the alert message after the element has been clicked.

* The custom written jQuery code for this project utilizes the 'Date' object from JavaScript to get the current day. It then utlizes if/then statements to decipher what variable dish will be implimented. Then, it selects the #deal id and inserts a string with the text after. This code is utilized on the main/home page in the aside under 'Deal of the Day'. 


##Coments
* None? I had far too many ideas for this site that I either don't have the knowledge or experience right now to impliment or didn't have the patience to figure out! Overall I'm fairly well with how it turned out and the obvious progress I have made in my learning journey this semester.
